## A story about the baroclinic instability over a sloping bottom

A summary list of functions used for data visualisation in Thesis Chapter 2 and Chapter 3.
- The NetCDF files sourced from post-processing SUNTANS modelling 
- Integrate with some calculation/QAQC functions

### Motivation 
- The confirmed and well-studied mesoscale eddy over the Australian NWorth West Shelf

- However, there are unresolved smaller scales dynamics along the coast
